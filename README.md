Project goal is to predict the survival rate of Titanic based on multiple passenger variables .

Use R library Brms to generate stan codes of 3 models:

1. Non-hierarchical model with variables: Sex, Age, P-Class
2. Non-hierarchical model with all variables
3. Hierarchical model with respect to group Sex and Age given P-Class.

Project contains:

* **sensitivity checking** with uninformative prior, Normal(0,1e6)and default student's t prior generated by brms.

* **Convergence diagnostics** (R-hat, k-value, divergence)

* **Posterior predictive analysis**

* **Model comparison** (with loo)
